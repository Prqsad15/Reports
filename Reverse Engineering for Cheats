7 - Feb 2025
As a beginner, I have started to learn reverse engineering, to make cheats, to improve security and improve my skills.
For this, I am using various tools such as Ghidra, cheat engine, and a few programming languages. 
Here, I will try and document my journey of learning reverse engineering.
For Day one, I learnt basics of cheat engine, and learnt to scan, modify and monitor values belonging to apps. 
Here, my test subject was an abandoned game, Need For Speed: Most Wanted from the year 2005.
Using this, one can modify things such as Cash, Bounty, etc.
This was done on 7th February 2025. This report will be updated regularly.

We had the event, so we it was tiring. Over the last two days, I have been expanding more on Ghidra.
I used a basic cheat exe as a case study, finding out pointers, to create a better cheat.
From that, I learnt more on Assembly, Ghidra, and a bit of x64 dbg
